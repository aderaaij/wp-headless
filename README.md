# WP Headless - A 'headless' WordPress install based on Bedrock

A [roots/Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) based WordPress installation to scratch my own itch: Easily spinning up and deploying a headless WordPress installation to a server to use as data source for front-end projects. Works out of the box with this [NextJS WPGraphQL WordPress starter](https://github.com/aderaaij/nextjs-wordpress-typescript)

## Headless theme

Redirects users to the admin login / admin area and offers a `functions.php` to add thumbnail support and other theme specific functions.

## WPGraphQL

WPGraphQL provides a GraphQL endpoint, schema and GUI for WordPress and is Included as a Must-Use (MU) plugin.
